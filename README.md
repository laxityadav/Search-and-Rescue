Application to perform search and rescue operation simulations for missing aircrafts.

## Description

Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find lost Aircrafts. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area.
This Application will use the Maps to find out the estimated area where an Aircraft would be, and then the search team can use this Map and other details to locate the lost Aircraft.
This application will calculate the location of the lost Aircraft using the various factors like the Last Known Position (LKP), velocity of the Aircraft, direction of the Aircraft and selecting appropriate search patterns.


## Principle
There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. 
First problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps and find a search area based on Last Known info of aircraft.
Second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible.

## üéØ  Why are we building this ?
Aircraft Disappearance have been happening from the previous century and since then the Aircrafts have gotten better but the number of aircrafts has also increased such that disappearances are still relevant today. The search and rescue operation do not have the tools that make use of mapping and processing technology available.
Finding the crash site in an aircraft disappearance is most of the problem for the search and rescue team. This is where the information about the aircraft is the most valuable resource for the team, And how to allocate their resources according to this information is the crucial decision.

## ‚ù§ Our Mission :  
Our mission is to find the Aircraft within minimum time in determined area by using less number of resources.
